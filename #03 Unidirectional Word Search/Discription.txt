Given a two-dimensional matrix of characters board and a string target, return whether the target can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down unidirectionally.

Constraints

n, m ≤ 250 where n is the number of rows and columns in board
k ≤ 250 where k is the length of word
Example 1
Input
board = [
    ["H", "E", "L", "L", "O"],
    ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
]
word = "HELLO"
Output
True
Example 2
Input
board = [
    ["x", "z", "d", "x"],
    ["p", "g", "u", "x"],
    ["k", "j", "z", "d"]
]
word = "xgz"
Output
False
Explanation
You can't make "xgz" going left-to-right or up-to-down.
