Find the indexes of the initial appearance of the maximum element in a matrix.

Input data format

On the input, the program receives the size of matrix n and m, and then n lines having m integer numbers in each. n and m do not exceed 100.

Output data format

Output two numbers: the row index and the column index, in which the greatest item in the two-dimensional array (matrix) is located. If there are several such elements, output the one, which has the smaller row index; and if row indexes are the same, output the one having the smaller column index.
