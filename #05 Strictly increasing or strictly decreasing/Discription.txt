Given a list of integers nums, return whether the list is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output
true
Explanation
This is strictly increasing.

Example 2
Input
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
Output
false
Explanation
Since there's two duplicate 5 this is not strictly increasing.

Example 3
Input
nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output
true
Explanation
This is strictly decreasing.
